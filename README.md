 My Episodes
The My Episodes Skill allows Mycroft to interact with [MyEpisodes.com](http://www.myepisodes.com)

## About 
You will be able to ask Mycroft to check the status of your shows list handled by [MyEpisodes.com](http://www.myepisodes.com). 
Mycroft will be able to give you the number of episodes not acquired and optionally the number of episodes acquired but not watched.
Also you will be able to find out the unacquired seasons and episdes numbers

## Examples 
* "check my episodes"
* "any new episodes"
* "check tv shows"
* "any new episodes"
* "anything new on my episodes"

## Posible future features and improvements
* Search and add shows to MyEPisodes.com list
* Mark shows as ignored/unignored
* Get status of show relative to the MyEpisodes.com user list (am I watching this show? or am I ignoring this show?)

## Under devevelopment
* Mark episodes as acquired and/watched 

**Please use the Issue reporting facility of Github if you have any ideeas on other functions or if you would like to prioritize the development of one function or another.**
